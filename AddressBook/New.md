OTP VERIFICATION AND EXAM ACCESS SYSTEM

Designed an OTP verification system that ensures users fully verify their email before accessing the exam. Once the OTP is successfully verified, the exam begins. If users fail to complete their email verification, they will be denied entry to the exam,  promoting security and integrity in the testing process

DESIGN OF AN ENERGY-EFFICIENT 8-TAP FIR FILTER IN 22NM DTMOS TECHNOLOGY

The design of an energy-efficient 8-tap FIR filter in 22nm DTMOS technology focuses on optimizing the filter's performance and power consumption by leveraging advanced DTMOS (Dynamic Threshold MOSFET) technology. This approach enhances the filter's efficiency by reducing power usage while maintaining high-speed operation, making it suitable for high-performance, low-power applications in modern integrated circuits.
